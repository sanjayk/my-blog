### A blurb on bad product managers

> Bad product managers have lots of excuses. Not enough funding, the engineering manager is an idiot, Microsoft has 10 times as many engineers working on it, I’m overworked, I don’t get enough direction. Barksdale doesn’t make these kinds of excuses and neither should the CEO of a product." - Ben Horowitz

The above is from a very very old blog post. It obviously needs an update.
Here are few things I found from my own experience.


* Bad product managers think they own Engineers.
* Bad product managers are mostly marketers (Nothing against marketers, you just can't act like a product manager).
* Bad product managers have a false sense of control.
* Bad product managers know very little about the technology that drives their product vision.

Finally and this is very important

* <b> Bad product managers like the idea of being product managers</b>.

<b>Kevin Systrom</b>, <b>Travis Kalanik</b> have a background in Computer Science, <b>Brain Chesky</b> went to Rhode Island school of design. These are the founders of Instagram, Uber and AirBnB. Companies that disrupted the status quo.

The point is, it is hard to find a good product manager and when you do, <b>you have to do whatever it takes to keep them</b>.
