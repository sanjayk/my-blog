### Blockchain, Bitcoin is still its killer app
Fred Wilson hit it! [http://avc.com/2016/11/proof-of-stake/]
I struggle with how Proof of Work is implemented in the
Blockchain. Also distributed P2P is not new, Bill Joy
started a project at Sun Microsystems called JXTA, there was Napster and there
still is BitTorrent.

Lets talk "smart contracts" as an example, it is a very different application
than say bitcoin is. In bitcoin there is an exchange of bits, meaning, once Bob
transfers a bitcoin to Alice Bob no longer posses that bitcoin, but with a
"smart contract", why can't Bob & Alice still have access to the contract?
Also the terms "smart contract" does not have a very clear and well settled
definition yet. Executing a piece of code to verify validity and having an
indemnity clause in your hand when things go south are very different. The
legal precedent here is still not fully established.

Having said that, I do believe there is a place for BlockChain technology to
be commercialized, Jut not the way it is being sold today. Just as
Goldman Sachs and Santander are bailing on R3's blockchain group

JPMC released code for their Ethereum based Blockchain solution
[https://github.com/jpmorganchase/quorum], at first glance it would appear like
between QuorumChain and Constellation we could get to a state where we can
properly define and verify proof of stake, it is still early going and the
design and architectural patterns even with QuorumChain seem unlikely to
satisfy the need for a super fast, fault tolerant, non energy guzzling,
highly secure (meaning resistant to state sponsored hacking) network that is
all the things to all the usecases.

The more I think about it the more I feel like the killer app for
Blockchain is still bitcoin much like file-sharing was for Bittorrent.
Until we agree on what the next killer app is for the Blockchain protocol,
all we are doing is trying to figure things out.
